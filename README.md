# Weather-Live
A script that understands the weather.
Haskell Script that on request "sayMeWeather" shows the weather in the selected city at the moment. There are two ways to use: 
- Compile the exe file from .hs file
- Use the Haskell GHCI interpreter to use the script.
Tip: if possible, do not use local languages to write the city, use English.
